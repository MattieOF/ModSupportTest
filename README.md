# ModSupportTest
 Very small test project to test an API for adding mod support to an app

### Projects
##### MSTApp
The startup project that creates a Game class and enters the run loop
##### MSTGame
The main logic for the app and the API for making 'mods'
##### TestMod and MultipleModImplementationsTest
The two test mods. TestMod is just a very basic mod and the other is the same but two IMod implementations in one assembly
